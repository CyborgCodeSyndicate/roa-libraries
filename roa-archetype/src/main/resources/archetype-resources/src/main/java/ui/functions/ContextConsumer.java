/**
 * Functional interface for UI synchronization hooks that accept both driver and locator context.
 * <p>
 * This interface extends {@link Consumer}{@code <SmartWebDriver>} to enable use as before/after
 * hooks in UI element definitions, while also providing {@link #asConsumer(By)} to bind a specific
 * locator to the wait function.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations (like {@link SharedUi}) can be used in two ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Directly as a {@code Consumer<SmartWebDriver>} when no locator is needed</li>
 *   <li>Via {@code asConsumer(locator)} to create a locator-specific consumer</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This pattern allows flexible reuse of wait strategies across different UI elements,
 * supporting both element-specific waits (with locator) and global waits (without locator).
